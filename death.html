Is it to be feared, or loved and embraced?<br>
What are these relationships that we carry through<br> 
our lives and beyond them? How can one gain enough spiritual<br>
knowledge and experience that one comes out of this cycle of rebirth?<br>
These are just a few of the many aspects that Sadhguru explores in Death.<br>
He is talking from a place where various spiritual planes exist. He carefully<br>
explains each plane and answers some most-asked questions of him. Now what happens<br>
needs to be understood from that point of view. And once that is understood, all mourning,<br>
all pain, all fear and all that that holds us back melts away
