    <p><br> Premchand is the most famous Hindi novelist and Godaan is<br>
        Premchand’s most celebrated novel. Economic and social <br>
        in a north Indian village are brilliantly captured in the<br>
        story of Hori, a poor farmer and his family’s struggle for <br>
        survival and self-respect. Hori does everything he can to fulfill<br>
        his life’s desire: to own a cow, the peasant’s measure of wealth<br>
        and well-being. Like many Hindus of his time, he believes that <br>
        making the gift of a cow to a Brahman before he dies will help <br>
        him achieve salvation. An engaging introduction to India before<br>
        Independence, Godaan is at once village ethnography, moving <br>
        human document and insightful colonial history.</p>
