    <p>The Power of Your Subconscious Mind has been a bestseller since its first publication <br>
    in 1963, selling many millions of copies since its original publication. It is one of the<br>
    most brilliant and beloved spiritual self-help works of all time which can help you heal yourself,<br>
    banish your fears, sleep better, enjoy better relationships and just feel happier. The techniques<br>
    are simple and results come quickly. You can improve your relationships, your finances, your physical<br>
    well-being.<br><br>
    Dr. Joseph Murphy explains that life events are actually the result of the workings of your<br>
    conscious and subconscious minds. He suggests practical techniques through which one can change<br>
    one's destiny, principally by focusing and redirecting this miraculous energy. Years of research<br>
    studying the world's major religions convinced him that some Great Power lay behind all spiritual<br>
    life and that this power is within each of us.
    <br><br>    
    The Power of Your Subconscious Mind will open a world of success, happiness, prosperity, and peace for you.</p>
