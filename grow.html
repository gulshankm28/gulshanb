    <p>I have absolutely zero knowledge of the Hindu religion outside the<br> 
    fact that it believes in reincarnation. This is strange considering how<br> 
    much research I have done it many Asian religions (like Buddhism, Confucianism,<br>
    Taoism, etc.). I came across this book among several lists of most important ancient books.

    It is a 700-verse scripture text (which is part of the Hindu epic Mahabharata,<br> 
    which I have heard referred to as The Illiad of India), telling of a conversation<br> 
    between the warrior prince Arjuna and Krishna, a god in Hinduism. In essence, it<br> 
    is Krishna explaining the beliefs of Hinduism to Arjuna, similar to The Sayings of<br>
    Confucius, which I read a couple years ago. Although the author of The Bhagavad Gita<br> 
    is uncertain, many historians attribute it to Vyasa. The book is dated anywhere from 500 BC to 200 BC.</p>
