    <P>Paulo Coelho's enchanting novel has inspired a devoted following around the world.<br>
    This story, dazzling in its powerful simplicity and soul-stirring wisdom, is about<br>
    an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago who travels from his homeland in Spain to<br> 
    the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried near the Pyramids. Along the way<br>
    he meets a Gypsy woman, a man who calls himself king, and an alchemist, all of whom<br>
    point Santiago in the direction of his quest. No one knows what the treasure is, or<br>
    if Santiago will be able to surmount the obstacles in his path. But what starts out<br>
    as a journey to find worldly goods turns into a discovery of the treasure found within.<br>
    Lush, evocative, and deeply humane, the story of Santiago is an eternal testament to<br>
    the transforming power of our dreams and the importance of listening to our hearts.</P>
